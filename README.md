# TodoList
Simple TodoList developed when learning ReactJS. Followed Brad Traversy's tutorial (https://www.traversymedia.com)

#What I learned
  1. ReactJS basics, file structure, components, props
  2. Fractional components and how they interact with App.js
  3. Using routing to move between pages
  4. Using axios to fetch dummy data from jsonplaceholder
  5. Some JSX and writing methods and passing arguments as props
